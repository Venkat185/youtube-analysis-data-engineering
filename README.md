## Technology Used
1. Programming Language - Python
2. AWS Cloud Platform
## Project Goals
This project aims to establish a robust data engineering pipeline on AWS to analyze YouTube data effectively. Key objectives include:

1. Data Ingestion: Develop a reliable system to extract YouTube data from diverse sources and store it in a centralized data lake on S3.
   
2. ETL Process: Implement an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using AWS Glue to clean, transform, and structure the raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
   
3. Scalable Data Architecture: Design a scalable data architecture that can accommodate increasing data volumes and processing demands.
   
4. Interactive Data Analysis: Utilize AWS Athena to query the data lake and gain valuable 
   insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.

5. Visual Data Exploration: Create interactive dashboards using Amazon QuickSight to visualize 
   key metrics, trends, and patterns in the YouTube data.
